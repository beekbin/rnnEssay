# An Essay about RNN/LSTM
This essay is about how to implement RNN/LSTM:

* How to train a vanilla RNN
* How to train a LSTM
* The **Gradient Vanishing** problem for RNN
* How can LSTM handle the **Gradient Vanishing** problem better than RNN


The implementation of RNN can be found my another project [simpleRNN](https://github.com/beekbin/simpleRNN).
