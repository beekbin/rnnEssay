# rnnEssay
An essay about how to implement RNN/LSTM.
In addition, it also explained the **Gradient Vanishing** problem for RNN, 
and how can LSTM handle the **Gradient Vanishing** problem better than RNN.

The implementation of RNN can be found my another project [simpleRNN](https://github.com/beekbin/simpleRNN).
